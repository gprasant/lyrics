the front gate\nHer daddy came out a-wavin' that 12-guage\nWe tore out the drive, he peppered my tailgate\nWhat was I thinkin'?\n\nOh, I knew there'd be hell to pay\nBut that crossed my mind a little too late\n\n'Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top\nSittin' right there in the middle by me\nAn' I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss\nMan, just gotta get goin', where the night might lead\n\nI know what I was feelin'\nBut what was I thinkin'?\nWhat was I thinkin'?\n\nBy the county line, the cops were nippin' on our heels\nPulled off the road an' kicked it in
