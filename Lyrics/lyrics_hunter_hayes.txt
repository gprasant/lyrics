[u"She rolled in from the west\r\nIn a summer sun dress\r\nHotter than the heat in July\r\nWith her wind blown hair\r\nIt just wasn't fair\r\nThe way she was blowin' my mind\r\nHave you ever noticed\r\nEvery hurricane gets its name from a girl like this\r\nShe's a cat. five kind\r\nKeeps you up at night\r\nHangin' on to the edge of a kiss\r\n\r\nShe's a beautiful mess\r\nThe kind you love to love\r\nBut what happens next\r\nI got a feeling when the sun comes up\r\n\r\nI'm gonna wish I had a storm warning\r\nI'm gonna wish I had a sign\r\nI'm gonna wish I had a little heads up\r\nLittle lee-way, little more time\r\nSome kind of radar system\r\nLocked in on love\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You know I'd fall apart without you\r\nI don't know how you do what you do\r\n'Cause everything that don't make sense about me\r\nMakes sense when I'm with you\r\nLike everything that's green, girl I need you\r\nBut it's more than one and one makes two\r\nPut aside the math and the logic of it\r\nYou gotta know you want it too\r\n\r\n'Cause I wanna wrap you up\r\nWanna kiss your lips\r\nI wanna make you feel wanted\r\nAnd I wanna call you mine\r\nWanna hold you hand forever\r\nNever let you forget it\r\nYeah, I wanna make you feel wanted\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Well, I've been searching for something true\nAnd my heart says it must be you\nI'd love to fall and see it through\nBut, only if you told me to\n\nWell, I'd run through the desert, I'd walk through rain\nGet you into trouble and take all the blame\nI'd paint you a picture, write you a song\nAnd I'd do it all over if I did all wrong\n\nI don't wanna steal you away,\nOr make you change the things that you believe\nI just wanna drink from the words you say,\nAnd be everything you need\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I tear the shrink wrap off,\nAnd put the needle down,\nFill my bedroom up with a Cash song,\nAnd crank it up loud,\nBecause it makes me feel good,\nGot the pedal pecked hard,\nAnd the Mustang drive,\nHorses screamin' at me,\nMomma prayin' that I'll make it home alive,\nBut it makes me feel good,\nLike sneakin'out late,\nTellin'white lies,\nStealin' one more kiss tonight.\n\nI try my best to behave,\nAnd I can't help feelin' this way,\nIt's not my fault so don't blame me,\n'Cause love makes me\nAnd is it some kind of fiction?\nOr the sweetest addiction?\nSowhat if I'm crazy,\n'Cause love makes me do it,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"People know that love is what they want,\nThey get caught up and then its gone\nThey can't get back the kiss they lost and\nSpend their whole life asking questions,\nNot knowing what went wrong\n\nBut, then the answers that you know just prove you wrong,\nGotta' have a little faith to fall back on\nAnd then all that you've got left is being strong,\nGotta' find a little faith to fall back on\n\nDidn't treat my girl like she was mine\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I'd love to know just what you're thinkin'\nEvery little river, runnin' through your mind\nYou give and you take, you come and you go\n\nYou leave me here wonderin' if I'll ever know\nHow much you care or how much you don't\nWhatever you need, whatever you want\n\nIf you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak\nIf you're gonna be somebody's mistake\nIf you're gonna be somebody's first time\nSomebody's last time, baby, be mine\n\nIf you're lookin' to be somebody's, 'just friends'\nA little laughin', little lovin'\nNever callin' again, that's just fine\nIf you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak\nBe mine, yeah, oh, be mine\n\nI guess that all I'm tryin' to tell ya'\nIs a minute with you is better than two without\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Say that you love me, even if it's not true.\nAnd say that this storm is just passing through.\nAnd, baby, tell me you're not leaving.\nIt's just the rainy season.\n\nThe air's getting heavy and we both know why.\nSo dance one more dance and tell one more lie.\nAnd, baby, let's keep make believing\nThat it's just the rainy season.\n\nWe're taking on water.\nAnd drop after drop we're destroying this house\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"When you try not to look at me\nScared that I'll see you hurting\nYou're not hiding anything, no\nAnd frankly its got me worried\nNobody knows you better than I do\nI keep my promises, I'm fighting for you\n\nYou're not alone\nI'll listen 'till your tears give out\nYou're safe and sound, I swear that I won't let you down\nWhat's hurting you I, I feel it too\nI mean it when I say\nWhen you cry, I cry with you, with you\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room\nSeems like everyone around me is on their honey moon\nI'd love to take a pin to a heart shaped balloon\nEverybody's got somebody but me\n\nWell I don't know how I landed on this movie set\nIt's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'\nI never would have noticed if we'd never met\nBut everybody's got somebody but me\n\nAnd I miss you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Who wakes you in the morning time, Who calls you every late night\nWho comforts you when you\u2019re in need, Who always tries to treat you right\nWho gives you all he has to give, Who would dedicate his heart to you\nWho fulfills all his promises and who sees the good in you\nTell me whatchya ya gonna do when I\u2019m gone\nOh and where your gonna go when there's nobody home\nAnd who\u2019s gonna love you when you\u2019re all alone\nTell me whatchya gonna do when I\u2019m gone\nYeah whatchya gonna do when I\u2019m gone\nI just wanna know\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******"]
