every word that you say\nExcuses for the answers that you lack\nYour mama's still the steady ground you walk on every day\nAnd your daddy's still the monkey on your back\n\nDid you find all you thought you'd\nFind out in the wild, wild west\nYou took a little piece of home\nAnd you threw away the rest\n\nYou say you're livin' on the edge and\nI think you're hangin' from a ledge\nToo scared to hold the hand\nThat wants to help you up\n\nAre you the man you thought you'd be\nBy the time that you turned 33\nAre you still a bullet in your daddy's gun\nDon't forget boy you're your mama's only son\nShe's at home and she's been praying for you\nSo what about Georgia\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"(Miranda Lambert & Rick Lambert)\n\nRain on the window
