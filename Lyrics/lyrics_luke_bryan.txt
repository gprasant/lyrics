rain is a good thing\r\n\r\nRain makes corn, corn makes whiskey\r\nWhiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky\r\nBack roads are boggin\' up, my buddies pile up in my truck\r\nWe hunt our honeys down, we take \'em into town\r\nStart washin\' all our worries down the drain\r\nRain is a good thing\r\n\r\nAin\'t nothin\' like a kiss out back in the barn\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for

my truck\r\nHow'd I get home from the club?\r\nAin't got a clue what went down\r\nSo I started calling around\r\n\r\nAnd all my friends say\r\nI started shooting doubles\r\nWhen you walked in\r\n\r\nAll my friends say\r\nI went a little crazy\r\nSeeing you with him\r\n\r\nYou know, I don't remember a thing\r\nBut they say I sure was raising some Cain\r\nI was a rock star, party hard\r\nGetting over you comeback kid\r\n\r\nYay, I must have did\r\nWhat all my friends say\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Hey girl, go on now!\r\nYou know you've
