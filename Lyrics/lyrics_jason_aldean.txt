yellow lines\nDisappear from time to time\nAnd I wound up on the wrong side of the road\n\nOn my highway I go too fast\nAfraid that I might finish last\nI hugged the curve too hard and lost control\nOh you never know which way it's gunna go\n\nBut what a feeling, chasing the sun\nLiving my life like a shot from a gun\nLaughing a little bit more with every mile\nOh what a freedom racing the wind\nDying to know what's around the next bend\nSmiling as I watch the years roll by\nI'm learning how to take it day by day on my highway\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"This life is full of choices\nHard to make one\nAll the voices in my head\nThose blue eyes I'm in love with\nOr that highway which ever I pick\nThere'll be regrets\n\nI go one way I lose everything\nI go the other way same thing\n\nI'm torn and it's tearing me apart\nI want to go but I don't want to break her heart\nLike a sword with a double edge blade\nIt's gonna cut deep either way\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'She had a shiny little Beemer with the rag top down\r\nSittin\' in the drive but she wouldn\'t get out\r\nThe dogs were all barkin\' and waggin\' around\r\nAnd I just laughed and said y\'all get in\r\n\r\nShe had on a new dress and she curled her hair\r\nShe was looking too good not to go somewhere\r\nSaid "what you want to do, baby, I don\'t care\r\nWe can go to the show, we can stay out here"\r\n\r\nAnd I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor\r\nWe can go slow or make it go faster\r\nDown through the woods and out to the pasture\r\n\'Long as I\'m with you it really don\'t matter\r\n\r\nClimb up in my lap and drive if you want to\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Tell 'em all I'm on vacation\nSay I went to visit friends\nThat you ain't heard or seen from me in quite a while\nWhen they ask you where I've been\n\nTell 'em I'm out on the West Coast\nWhere it don't ever rain\nAnd that I'm probably doing fine\n\nJust don't tell 'em I've gone crazy\nThat I'm still strung out over you\nTell 'em anything you want to\nJust don't tell 'em all the truth\nYeah, don't tell 'em all the truth\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"You boys ever met a real country girl?\r\nI'm talkin' true blue, out in the woods\r\nDown home country\r\n\r\nShe's a hot little number in her pick-up truck\r\nDaddy's sweet money done jacked it up\r\nShe's a party all-nighter from South Carolina\r\nA bad mamma-jamma from down in Alabama\r\nShe's a ragin' Cajun, lunatic from Brunswick,\r\nJuicy Georgia peach,\r\nWith a thick southern drawl, sexy swingin' walk\r\n\r\nBrother she's all country, shoot,\r\nFrom her cowboy boots to her down home roots\r\nShe's country,\r\nFrom the song she plays to the prayer she prays\r\nThat's the way she was born and raised,\r\nShe ain't afraid to stay country\r\nBrother she's
