[u"Give me a second I\r\nI need to get my story straight\r\nMy friends are in the bathroom\r\ngetting higher than the Empire State\r\nmy lover she's waiting for me\r\njust across the bar\r\nMy seats been taken by some sunglasses\r\nasking 'bout a scar\r\nand I know I gave it to you months ago\r\nI know you're trying to forget\r\nbut between the drinks and subtle things\r\nthe holes in my apologies\r\nyou know I'm trying hard to take it back\r\nso if by the time the bar closes\r\nand you feel like falling down\r\nI'll carry you home\r\n\r\nTonight\r\nWe are young\r\nSo let's set the world on fire\r\nWe can burn brighter\r\nthan the sun\r\n\r\nTonight\r\nwe are young\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******"]
