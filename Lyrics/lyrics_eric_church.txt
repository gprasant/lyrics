lawn\r\nDiscount shades, store bought tan,\r\nFlip flops and cut off jeans\r\nSomwhere between that setting sun\r\nI'm on fire and born to run\r\nYou looked at me and I was done\r\nWell, we're just getting started\r\nI was singin' to you, you were singin' to me\r\nI was so alive, never been more free\r\nFired up my daddy's lighter and sang Oh-h-h-h-h-h\r\nStayed there 'til they forced us out\r\nTook the long way to your house\r\nI canstill hear the sound of you saying don't go\r\nWhen I think about you, I think about 17,\r\nI think about my old jeep\r\nI think about the stars in the sky\r\nFunny how a melody sounds like a memory\r\nLike a soundtrack to a July Saturday night\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Read it in the paper\nMarked the date on the wall\nTo remind myself to celebrate\nThe day I lose it all\n\nAin't made plans to be together\nI made plans to be alone\nShe got a rock\nAnd I'm gettin' stoned\n\nDamn right, I've got objections\nBut it's an awful too late now\nYeah, the cans are on the Limo\nAnd their ashes on the ground\n\nNow they're headed for the islands\nBut, hell, I'm already gone\nShe got a rock\nAnd I'm

I believe in peace\nBut I don't believe we'll ever see it\nIn that Middle East\nI believe the Bible is cold, hard fact\nAn' I believe that Jesus is comin' back\nBefore she does\n\nI believe the Sabbath is a day of rest\nThe taxman an' the Devil share the same address\nI believe don't start if you're gonna quit\nI believe in keep your mouth shut\nAn' carry a big stick\n...\n\n******* This

a long line of sinners like me."\n\nNow me an\' my brother go to see him sometimes,\nBut he don\'t have much to say anymore.\nSo we sit on his headstone with a fifth of Jack D:\nHere\'s to a long line of sinners like me.\n\nLa de da, de da, la de da da, de de:\nI come from a long line of sinners like me.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"I know where I come from:\nHow 'bout you?\nI don't need baggy clothes,\nOr rings in my nose to be cool.\nThe scars on my knuckles,\nMatch these scuffs on these cowboy boots.\nAn' there's a whole lot more like me:\nHow 'bout you?\n\nI punch the clock tryin' to make it to the top:\nHow 'bout you?\nI ain't got no blue-blood trust fund,\nI can dip in to.\nYeah, I wish Uncle Sam would give a damn,\nAbout the man who's collar's blue.\nBut if he don't, hell, I'll make it on my own:\nHow 'bout you?\n\nAn' how 'bout you?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"These boots have counted off many a band,\nPlayin' one night roadhouse stands,\nFor tips an' empty rooms.\nThese boots have stood toe-to-toe.\nWith the biggest, baddest Joes,\nLike they had some things to prove:\nThese boots.\n\nYeah, these boots, more than once saved my ass.\nLike the time they had that grass,\nFrom those cops in Tupelo.\nAn' these boots have danced with the devil,\nAn' nearly lost that battle,\nAn' to a wild Irish rose.\n\nI've wore out more soles than I'd care to count,\nAn' done more stupid things than most with them too.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"It was my senior year, I just turned eighteen\nI was a Friday night hero with division one dreams\nI had an offer on the table, a four year ride\n'Til that fourth and two, and twenty four dive\n\nAnd I left on a stretcher, wound up on a crutch\nWalked on that next summer, wound up getting cut\nI flipped off that coach, left that school in the dust\nFor letting my dreams go bust\n\nBut I thank God I ain't what I almost was\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Only fools would race down Grist Mill Road\nLet alone in angry weather\nThat's what I tell everyone I know\nNow that I know better\n\nThat's a lesson I wish I would've learned\nWithout havin' to watch my Mustang burn\nBefore my best buddy had to wind up hurt\nAn' his whole life was changed\n\nThat's a lesson I wish I didn't learn\nThe hard way\n\nOnly a fool would keep a diamond ring\nIn a box on the top of his closet\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I wear a greasy ball-cap\nI like my shirt untucked.\nI spend Saturday's workin' on my truck.\nI don't like to fight but I ain't scared to bleed.\nMost don't mess with a guy like me.\n\n'Cause guys like me drink too many beers,\nOn Friday after work.\nMy best blue jeans have Skol rings;\nWe wear our boots to church.\nSo rough around the edges, it's hard to believe,\nThat girls like you love guys like me.\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'These four walls of Fort Worth\nAre closin\' in on me\nMy final meter\'s over\nAn\' they\'re gonna set me free\n\nI can feel the fire\'s a burnin\'\nAs the devil guards my door\nI hit my knees in search of Jesus\nOn a cold jail house floor\n\nLord, now I\'m singin\', "Get me out of here"\nI see the preacher\'s eyes\nAs my daughter cries\nWhen they strap me in this chair\n\nLord, I hope she forgives me\nFor livin\' my life this way\nTonight I ride the lightning\nTo my final judgment day\n\n\'Every life owes a debt\'\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"Never realised how much she brought to the table.\nTill I went to sit my cup of coffee where the table used to be.\nNo cats, no bed, no heirloom antique cradle,\nAn' no more hope for one day startin' that family.\nBet she's gainin' fast on Memphis with a trailer-load in tow.\nWho says you can't take it with you when you go?\n\n'Cause she got away with everything that I had goin';\nAn' she got away 'fore I could make it all alright.\nAn' I got away with leavin' what needs said unspoken.\nHell, I even blew the chance I had to say goodbye.\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"There's a little dive on a dead-end road,\nCalled the Cross-Eyed Cricket Waterin' Hole,\nWhere you can hear the sound of a steel-guitar,\nAn' get loud an' rowdy on PBR.\nBut at the top of every hour, man, you can hear a pin drop,\nAs ol' Jack drops in a quarter an' plays Merle on the jukebox, an' we stop:\n\nAn' tip our hats,\nAn' raise our glasses of cold, cold beer.\nThey say country's fadin',\nBut we're still wavin' that flag around here.\nAn' when it's time to go, you know you're welcome back,\nWhere the people pledge allegiance to The Hag.\n\nWhen the weekend comes an' the weather's clear,\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'You were too bad for a little square town\r\nWith your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground\r\nHeard you cussed out mama, pushed daddy around\r\nbefore you tore off in his car\r\n\r\nHere you are running these dirty old streets\r\nTattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth\r\nGot the \u2018hood here snowed, but you can\u2019t fool me\r\nWe both know who you are\r\n\r\nHomeboy, you\u2019re gonna wish one day,\r\nThat you were sittin\u2019 on a gate of a truck by the lake\r\nWith your high school flame on one side, ice cold beer on the other\r\nAin\u2019t no shame in a blue collar forty, \r\nlittle house, little kid, little small town story\r\nIf you don\u2019t ever do anything else for me, \r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******']
