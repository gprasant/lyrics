[u"Ain't this what you came for\r\nDon't you wish you came, oh\r\nGirl what you're playing for\r\nCome on, let me kiss that\r\nOoh, I know you miss that\r\nWhat's wrong, let me fix that\r\nTwist that\r\n\r\nBaby, tonight's the night I let you know\r\nBaby, tonight's the night we lose control\r\nBaby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that\r\nTonight I'll be the best you ever had\r\n\r\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\r\nThe best you ever had\r\n\r\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\r\nThe best you ever had\r\n\r\nI hit you with the best flow,\r\nFreestlying in the restroom\r\nTil you blowing cigarette smoke\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******"]
