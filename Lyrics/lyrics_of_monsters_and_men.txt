Hey!\r\nI don't like walking around this old and empty house\r\nSo hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear\r\nThe stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake\r\nIt's the house telling you to close your eyes\r\n\r\nSome days I can't even trust myself\r\nIt's killing me to see you this way\r\n\r\n'Cause though the truth may vary\r\nThis ship will carry\r\nOur bodies safe to shore\r\n\r\nHey! Hey! Hey!\r\nThere's an old voice in my head that's holding me back\r\nWell tell her that I miss our little talks\r\nSoon it will all be over and buried with our past\r\nWe used to play outside when we were young,\r\nAnd full of life and full of love\r\n\r\nSome days I don't know if I am wrong or right\r\nYour mind is playing tricks on you, my dear\r\n\r\n'Cause though the truth may vary\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Hey!
