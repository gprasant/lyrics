Lord\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"This city's looking like a ghost town\r\nAll the stores downtown they've been closing down\r\nYeah, the only lights that shine for miles\r\nAre lighting up the sky above memorial drive\r\n\r\nAnd if you want a seat you better come on down\r\n'Cause when the band fires up that old glory sound\r\nThis is the moment we've all been waiting for\r\nLining them up, and the whistle blows\r\n\r\nThis ain't no game around here\r\nIt's more like religion\r\nWe've built this thing 'round here\r\nA football tradition\r\nSo everybody get up\r\nAnd feast your eyes\r\nOn the highlight of small town life\r\nIt's Friday night\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Grew up one state North of Kentucky\r\nA Family far from rollin' in the money\r\n7 brothers and sisters to feed and love\r\nGranddaddy said she kept her eyes on the sky,\r\nWatching all the little birds fly\r\nStaring at heaven like her lost home\r\nNone of her dreams held fame and fortune\r\nShe wanted a husband and children that loved her\r\n\r\nSpreading' her wings her feet left ground In Indian\r\nDriving down south just to marry my daddy\r\nLeaving the life she'd known and loved behind\r\nShe never cussed or drank, kept food on the table\r\nHell, I kept her on her knees in prayer\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for

pulled up with a license plate\r\nFrom Ohio I thought of good lord he's lost\r\nFrom his wranglers to his boots\r\nHe reminded me of Chris LeDoux\r\nAnd that Copenhagen smile\r\n\r\nCountry must be country wide\r\nIn every state\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"They say I was baptized in dirty water\nBy the hands of the devil himself\nBetween the banks of a Whiskey River\nBeside the Highway to Hell\nI got scars on my heart and knuckles\nI got debts that I ain't paid\nYeah, but I got blessings sent down from heaven\nBaby, you're my saving grace\nGirl, you got an outlaw\nReady to lay down all my guns\nA dirty old hound dog\nLearning new tricks like cuddling up\nYou've got a hellcat purring like a kitten\nYou've got a sinner down on his knees\nIt had to be hell on an angel\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******"]
