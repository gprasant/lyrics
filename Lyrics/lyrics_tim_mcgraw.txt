rain\nShe'd never leave that one\nSo, she can't be really gone\n\nThe shoes she bought on Christmas Eve\nShe laughed and said they called her name\nIt's like they're waiting in the hall\nFor her to slip them on\nSo, she can't be really gone\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Here we are\nWhat is left of a husband and a wife\nWith four good kids\nWho have a way of getting on with their lives\nAnd i'm not old but i'm gettin' a whole lot older everyday\nIt's too late to keep from goin' crazy\nI've got to get away\n\nchorus:\nThe reasons that i can't stay\nDon't have a thing to do with bein' in love\nAnd i understand that lovin' a man\nShouldn't have to be this rough\nAnd you ain't the only one\nWho feels like this world's left you far behind\nI don't know why you gotta be\nAngry all the time\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"I'm so glad that I met you, baby\nI'm so proud when we walk in the room\nI know it's crazy to worry like I do\nI get this feelin' that I'm losing you\n\nI get these suspicions\nEven though I know that you love me, baby\nAnd I really shouldn't feel this way\nOoh, suspicions\nI can't help it, you're just so good lookin'\nI'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me\n\nWhen I go out to a party with you\nYou always turn every head in the room\nAnd I just know what's on every man's mind\nI try to fight it but it gets me sometimes\n\nI get these suspicions\nEven though I know that you love me, baby\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u'Run your car off the side of the road\nGet stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere\nOr get yourself in a bind,\nLose the shirt off your back,\nNeed a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare...\n\nThis is where the rubber meets the road\nThis is where the cream is gonna rise\nThis is what you really didn\'t know\nThis is where the truth don\'t lie\n\nYou find out who your friends are\nSomebody\'s gonna drop everything\nRun out and crank up their car\nHit the gas, get there fast\nNever stop to think\n"What\'s in it for me?"\nOr "It\'s way too far"\nThey just show on up\nWith their big ol\' heart\nYou find out who your friends are...\n\nEverybody wants to slap your back\nWants to shake your hand\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******', u"I been caught sideways out here on the crossroads\r\nTryin' to buy back the pieces I lost of my soul\r\nIt's hard when the devil won't get off your back\r\nIt's like carryin' around the past in a hundred pound sack\r\n\r\nToday, I'm gonna keep on walkin'\r\nI'm gonna hold my head up high\r\nGonna leave it all behind\r\nToday, I'm gonna stand out in the rain\r\nLet it wash it all away, yeah wash it all away\r\nI'm gonna let it go, Oh oh, Oh yeah\r\nI'm gonna let it go, oh oh, Oh yeah\r\n\r\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******"]
