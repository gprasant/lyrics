the Devil, chasin' after the dust\nMake a fuss if it's them, but we hush if it's us\n\nThat's why, my momma said she wanted\nSomethin' real, real, real, real, real\nSomethin' she could be proud of\nSomethin' she could feel, feel, feel, feel, feel\n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******", u"Uh, what up y'all!\nSoundtrack what's popping baby?\nY'all ain't know, I go by
